        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Whenever I read about temples that blur the line between devotion and art, Chennakeshava Temple instantly stands out to me. Located in Belur, this temple feels like a divine sculpture gallery where every stone breathes faith. For me, it represents how beauty itself can become a form of worship when created with surrender and skill.</p>

        <h2>Temple Description</h2>
        <p>Chennakeshava Temple is dedicated to Lord Vishnu in his beautiful form as Kesava and was commissioned in 1117 CE by the Hoysala king Vishnuvardhana. Built entirely from soft soapstone, the temple is world-renowned for its extraordinary carvings that narrate stories from the Ramayana, Mahabharata, and Bhagavata Purana. Walking through this temple feels like reading sacred scriptures carved directly into stone.Chennakeshava Temple is dedicated to Lord Vishnu in his beautiful form as Kesava and was commissioned in 1117 CE by the Hoysala king Vishnuvardhana.

Walking through this temple feels like reading sacred scriptures carved directly into stone.Historically, the temple marks the rise of the Hoysala Empire as a dominant cultural and political force in South India. King Vishnuvardhana built it to commemorate his victory over the Cholas and his transformation into a powerful Vaishnava ruler. Over centuries, the temple remained a center for art, ritual, and royal patronage, preserving Karnataka’s architectural identity.</p>

        <h2>Spiritual Significance</h2>
        <p>Spiritually, this temple symbolizes devotion expressed through perfection. Lord Chennakeshava here represents Vishnu as the preserver of cosmic order, grace, and beauty. To me, the temple teaches that spirituality is not only about renunciation but also about celebrating divine harmony through creativity, balance, and detail.Architecturally, Chennakeshava Temple is a masterpiece of Hoysala architecture. The star-shaped platform, lathe-turned pillars, intricately carved ceilings, and jewel-like sculptures make it one of the most refined temples ever built in India. The detailing is so precise that even strands of hair, ornaments, and expressions are sculpted with astonishing realism. I feel this temple proves that patience and devotion can turn stone into life.</p>

        <h2>Daily Rituals & Practices</h2>
        <p>Daily rituals at Chennakeshava Temple include traditional Vishnu worship practices such as Alankara, Archana, and Deeparadhana. Although it is now also a protected heritage monument, worship continues to maintain the temple’s living spiritual essence. For me, this balance between preservation and devotion makes the temple even more special.Major festivals celebrated here include Vaikuntha Ekadashi, Janmashtami, and annual temple celebrations dedicated to Lord Vishnu. During these times, the temple comes alive with music, lamps, and rituals, reconnecting the carvings and corridors with their original devotional purpose.</p>
