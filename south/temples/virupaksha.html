        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>When I think of a temple that has silently witnessed the rise and fall of empires yet continues its worship uninterrupted, Virupaksha Temple in Hampi stands tall in my heart. Located on the banks of the Tungabhadra River, this temple feels ancient, grounded, and immensely powerful. Walking through its corridors in my imagination itself gives me the feeling of stepping into a living chapter of Indian history and devotion.</p>

        <h2>Temple Description</h2>
        <p>Virupaksha Temple is one of the oldest functioning temples in India, with its origins dating back to at least the 7th century CE. Dedicated to Lord Virupaksha, a fierce and ancient form of Shiva, the temple later became the spiritual nucleus of the Vijayanagara Empire. Unlike many ruined structures of Hampi, this temple continues daily worship, making it a bridge between the ancient past and the present. To me, this continuity itself feels sacred.Architecturally, Virupaksha Temple is a classic example of Dravidian temple design layered with Vijayanagara aesthetics. The most striking feature is the towering eastern gopuram, built in the 15th century, which dominates the Hampi skyline. Inside, the pillared halls, stone ceilings, and sculptures narrate stories of gods, devotees, and celestial beings. One fascinating detail is the temple’s natural pinhole camera effect, where the image of the gopuram is projected upside down inside a dark chamber — a silent blend of science and spirituality that amazes me every time.</p>

        <h2>Spiritual Significance</h2>
        <p>Historically, Virupaksha Temple was the heart of the Vijayanagara Empire, one of the greatest Hindu kingdoms in Indian history. Kings, scholars, dancers, and devotees once gathered here in massive numbers. Even after the devastating fall of Vijayanagara in the 16th century, this temple survived destruction and continued worship, standing as a symbol of resilience. For me, it reflects how faith can outlast political power.Spiritually, Virupaksha represents Shiva as the eternal protector and cosmic force. The temple is closely associated with Goddess Pampadevi, a local form of Parvati, whose union with Virupaksha symbolizes divine harmony rooted in the land itself. Standing for timeless Shaiva devotion, this temple makes me feel that spirituality does not need grandeur alone — it needs continuity, faith, and presence.</p>

    <section>
        <h2>Daily Rituals & Practices</h2>
        <p>Daily rituals at Virupaksha Temple are performed with traditional Shaiva practices including Abhishekam, Alankaram, and Deeparadhana. The sound of bells, Vedic chants, and the presence of devotees create a calm yet powerful atmosphere. What touches me deeply is that these rituals have continued for centuries without interruption, making every prayer feel connected to countless prayers before it.The most important festival celebrated here is the annual chariot festival dedicated to Virupaksha and Pampadevi. During this time, the temple becomes vibrant with processions, music, and devotion. Maha Shivaratri is also celebrated with great reverence, drawing devotees from across Karnataka and beyond. These festivals make the temple feel alive, not frozen in history.</p>
