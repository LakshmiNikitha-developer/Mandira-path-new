        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The Nageshwara Temple near Nellore is a recently rediscovered Shiva temple, believed to be around 200–300 years old, that was buried under sand dunes for decades before being unearthed by local villagers. Situated near the Penna River, about 60 kilometers from Nellore city, this temple has gained attention not only for its historical and spiritual significance but also for its unique architectural features and recent popular culture recognition after appearing in the introduction sequence of the Kalki 2898 AD movie. The temple exemplifies how hidden historical treasures can lie beneath the sands, waiting to reveal rich insights into regional heritage.The Nageshwara Temple’s uniqueness lies in its recent discovery after being buried for decades, its rare brick construction with a circular sanctum and vimana, intricate carvings, and its emerging recognition in modern culture through media like the Kalki 2898 AD movie. It is an example of how regional history can remain hidden, only to be revived and celebrated as a significant cultural and spiritual site.</p>

        <h2>Temple Description</h2>
        <p>The Nageshwara Temple is constructed primarily of brick, which sets it apart from many stone temples of the region. Its main sanctum, or garbhagriha, is small and circular, capped with a distinctive circular vimana (tower), reflecting an unusual design for South Indian temples. Intricate carvings adorn its walls, and the interior of the sanctum is small, dark, and ancient-feeling, with sunlight entering only through a hole in the kalasam (finial) atop the vimana. The structure and layout demonstrate traditional temple symbolism adapted to brick construction, which is rare for this region, giving the temple both historical and architectural uniqueness.The temple’s brick construction, circular garbhagriha, and unusual vimana distinguish it from typical South Indian stone temples. Its small size and compact design suggest an intimate ritual space, while the circular plan and brick masonry reflect adaptive building techniques suitable for the region and materials available during its construction. The intricate carvings on the brick walls show skilled craftsmanship, and the way light enters the sanctum through the kalasam demonstrates thoughtful symbolic and functional design. This combination of uniqueness, craftsmanship, and adaptation to environmental conditions makes the Nageshwara Temple a rare and noteworthy architectural site.</p>

        <h2>Spiritual Significance</h2>
        <p>Local legends suggest that the temple may have been consecrated by Lord Parasurama, linking it to ancient Shaivite traditions. Its gradual burial by sand is believed to have occurred around the 1850s due to Penna River floods, which caused the temple to be forgotten for generations. The rediscovery by villagers in 2020 underscores the temple’s historical importance, showing continuity of spiritual practice in the region despite periods of neglect. As a recently found temple, it is now becoming a site of religious reverence, archaeological interest, and cultural tourism, marking an important addition to the temple heritage of Andhra Pradesh.</p>

        <h2>Daily Rituals & Practices</h2>
        <p>Being a recently rediscovered temple, regular daily rituals are not yet fully established, but local villagers and devotees have begun performing worship and basic Shaivite rites. During festivals, particularly Maha Shivaratri, the temple attracts visitors eager to honor Lord Shiva and witness the unique structure, gradually reinstating its spiritual relevance in the local community.</p>
